# Disable Translation Management in WPML
Disable the Translation Management in WPML when it is not needed to avoid confusion.

## Installation
Simply copy the `wpml-disable-translation-management.php` file inside your `mu-plugins` directory. It is crucial to copy the file in your must-use plugins folder as it won't work as a regular plugin
